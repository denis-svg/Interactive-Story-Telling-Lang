\chapter*{Abstract}

The problem being dealt with is the need for a more intuitive and user-friendly DSL for creating interactive stories with branching paths and multiple outcomes. The language should incorporate declarative and imperative syntax, objects, variables, and collections, and require user input in the form of choices and interactions. User-generated content and various types of output can enhance the storytelling experience. The goal is to create a program that allows for dynamic, personalized stories that engage the reader and encourage active participation.
